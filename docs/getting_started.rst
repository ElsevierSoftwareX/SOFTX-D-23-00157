This chapter introduces the usage of Slitflow by running the following two examples:

* :ref:`Basic usage <getting_started_basic:Basic usage>` : Simulating random walks and making the Mean Square Displacement (MSD) figure.
* :ref:`Advanced usage <getting_started_advanced:Advanced usage>` : Tracking single molecules in videos and performing state-of-the-art mobility analysis.
  
These examples can be run on the cloud using `Gitpod <https://www.gitpod.io/>`_ or
`Google Colaboratory <https://colab.research.google.com/>`_ with your web browser,
or on your computer with Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks.
