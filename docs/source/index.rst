**Slitflow** is a flexible Python framework that provides a complete workflow for
complex single-molecule analysis by a comprehensive architecture based on
clarified reproducibility and accessibility.

The package creates a series of processes, including image pre-processing,
tracking, localization analysis, data sorting, and figure creation, by
connecting simple task objects corresponding to each result file.

Slitflow is designed by considering users who develop analysis tools,
validate multiple analysis methods, reproduce workflows without programming
skills, and use results without installing the software.
